           And a well-curated NatterSearch summary can offer them a wealth of information about your professional background.
          <br> So whether you’re just quietly cruising through options or firing off applications like it’s your other job, <br>
           you want your profile to shine. <br>

          Maybe you’ve already done the obvious, making hundreds of connections and racking up tons of endorsements.
          <br> But there are still all these boxes where your writing is supposed to go, <br>
          and you’re never quite sure what to say.
